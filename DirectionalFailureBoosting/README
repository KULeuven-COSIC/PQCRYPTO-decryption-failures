To run the scripts:

## generate all the numbers and figures from the paper (except Appendix B)
# standard running gives the results from the paper
# more option with -h
sage main.py

## experiment from Appendix B
# standard number of estimates, decryption failures and successes generated is 1000
# you can increase this with -e num_estimates -f num_failures -s num_successes
# more option with -h
sage directional_failure_boosting.py
