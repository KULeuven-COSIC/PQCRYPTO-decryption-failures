The attack can be run using the following commands:

cd KeccakCodePackage
make generic64/libkeccak.a
cd ..
make attack
./attack deadbeef
or ./attack deadbeef -v (if you want to know the inner workings of the attack)

deadbeef is the initialization of the randomness and can be swapped with other hexadecimal inputs
